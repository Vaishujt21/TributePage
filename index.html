            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Vivekananda was born as Narendranath Datta (name shortened to Narendra or Naren)[18] in a Bengali
                family[19][20] in his ancestral home at 3 Gourmohan Mukherjee Street in Calcutta,[21] the capital of
                British India, on 12 January 1863 during the Makar Sankranti festival.[22] He belonged to a traditional
                family and was one of nine siblings.[23] His father, Vishwanath Datta, was an attorney at the Calcutta
                High Court.[19][24] Durgacharan Datta, Narendra's grandfather was a Sanskrit and Persian scholar[25] who
                left his family and became a monk at age twenty-five.[26] His mother, Bhubaneswari Devi, was a devout
                housewife.</p>
            <p> Narendranath was interested in spirituality from a young age and used to meditate before the images of
                deities such as Shiva, Rama, Sita, and Mahavir Hanuman.[29] He was fascinated by wandering ascetics and
                monks.[28] Narendra was mischievous and restless as a child, and his parents often had difficulty
                controlling him. His mother said, "I prayed to Shiva for a son and he has sent me one of his
                demons".[26]</p>
